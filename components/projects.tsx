    description:
      "Built a smart diet app that helps people figure out how much they should eat based on their age, weight, and height. It gives daily calorie targets, food suggestions, and even some motivational vibes using OpenAI. Used Firebase for user login and data, and built the whole thing with React Native (or Next.js) on the front and Node.js on the back. Basically, it’s like having a chill personal trainer in your pocket.",
